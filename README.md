                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi , my name is S.T Neshat but you may know me by my nickname Al. I’m going to be  studying nanotechnology  engineering in the fall September 2017 at University of Waterloo. After I receive my bachelors degree in nano, I want to pursue my MaSc degree in Mechatronics Engineering</p>

<p>I was part of FRC in highschool from 2015-2017 and I am very greatful to have given this oppurtunity to pursue my degree in nanotechnology engineering. When I was involved in FIRST, I was operating drills and drill presses, band saws and  as well as making real-life engineering decisions. I also got the oppurtunity to work on CAD models, talk to manufacturing companies, and do volunteer work. I got the chance to experience what it’s like to be a in a project leader role, including all the pressure and dynamics that goes along with it. Even if you won’t be in a leadership role, FIRST robotics to me was by far one of the most real-world high school activity I have had the pleasure of being involved in.  </p> 

<p>I am also a synchronize swimmer and have been recently accepted to be part of the Canadian National Team Of Synchronize Swimming Team.</p>

<p>Being in a competitive environment has helped me stimulate my intellectual vitality and learn to thrive in a challenging environment. </p>

                <p>A merge of an old blog and new interests, I started <a href="http://jessicaslaughter.co" target="_blank">this blog</a> in January 2016 as a more casual environment to share college and lifestyle tips, while continuing to help others start their own blogs! I've since garnered an audience of young women around the world providing over 100,000 monthly views, and have been accepted to influencer networks including <a href="http://collectivelyinc.com/" target="_blank">Collectively</a>, the <a href="http://www.hercampusmedia.com/services/influenceher-collective" target="_blank">InfluenceHer Collective</a>, and <a href="http://whoispollinate.com/" target="_blank">Pollinate Media</a>. I've also had the opportunity to collaborate with brands like PayPal, Office Depot, Target, and Evernote to create content that generates engagement and awareness for both my blog and their products.
